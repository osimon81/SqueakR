# SqueakR: An Experiment Superstructure for DeepSqueak

Welcome to the `SqueakR` package!

## Installation

### From CRAN

To install the CRAN release of the package, run the following code:

    install.packages(SqueakR)
    library(SqueakR)
    
### From GitHub

To install the development version of `SqueakR`, run the following code (ensure devtools is loaded first):

    install_github("osimon81/SqueakR")
    library(SqueakR)

`SqueakR` represents a suite of programs designed to assist researchers with processing and exploring data from experiments which use DeepSqueak for bioacoustics projects. DeepSqueak is a machine-vision program capable of aggregating detected vocalizations based on the features a call might have, allowing subsequent analysis of call syntax, significant changes in call features across groups, etc.

For reference, the entire `SqueakR` suite and documentation can be found [under this GitHub list](https://github.com/stars/osimon81/lists/squeakr).

## Resources

The tools and resources available under `SqueakR` include:

-   The `SqueakR` [pkgdown website](https://osimon81.github.io/SqueakR/ "SqueakR Pkgdown Website on GitHub") available through GitHub. Detailed information about its functions can be found under the [Reference](https://osimon81.github.io/SqueakR/reference/index.html "Reference tab on pkgdown") tab. The [Get started](https://osimon81.github.io/SqueakR/articles/SqueakR.html "Getting started tab on pkgdown") the recommended site for learning how to use the package.

-   The [main `SqueakR` Package repository](https://github.com/osimon81/SqueakR "The GitHub repository for SqueakR"), and the corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/osimon81/SqueakR/wiki "SqueakR Wiki") and [Discussions](https://github.com/osimon81/SqueakR/discussions "Discussions page for SqueakR repo") sections.

    -   **This Discussions section** under the main SqueakR repository will be the forum for announcements, discussions, and troubleshooting anything related to either SqueakR or the Shiny SqueakR Dashboard.

    -   However, *both sites have separate wikis,* to keep documentation organized.

-   The [Shiny `SqueakR` Dashboard repository](https://github.com/osimon81/SqueakR-Dashboard "Repository for Shiny SqueakR Dashboard"), and the accompanying [Wiki](https://github.com/osimon81/SqueakR-Dashboard/wiki "SqueakR-Dashboard Wiki") section, which contains documentation for running analysis and visualizing data through the `SqueakR` Shiny dashboard.

-   The [`SqueakR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SqueakR "SqueakR Website on CRAN") package itself, and documentation describing its functions, on CRAN.
